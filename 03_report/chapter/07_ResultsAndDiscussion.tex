\section{Results and Discussion}
Simulation results for setpoint tracking, disturbance rejection, and trajectory following are presented and analyzed. The behavior of the system with and without feedforward is compared, and the effects of noise, saturation, and modeling errors are discussed. The results are contrasted with experimental measurements to evaluate accuracy and robustness.
