\chapter{Simulation Setup}
This chapter describes the Simulink implementation of the complete closed-loop system, consisting of the nonlinear plant, fan PT1 dynamics, PID control, noise injection, saturations, and state limitations. The structure of the simulation model is documented, and all relevant block diagrams are presented to provide a clear understanding of the computational setup.
