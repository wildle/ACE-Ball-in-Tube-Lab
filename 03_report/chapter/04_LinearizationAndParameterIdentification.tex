\section{Linearization and Parameter Identification}
The nonlinear state-space model is linearized around a selected operating point to enable classical controller design. The resulting linear system matrices and transfer functions are derived. In addition, this chapter explains how the system parameters such as $\alpha_i$, $k_\omega$, $\tau_\omega$, and the voltage offset $u_0$ are obtained through measurement data, steady-state evaluation, or provided laboratory constants.
