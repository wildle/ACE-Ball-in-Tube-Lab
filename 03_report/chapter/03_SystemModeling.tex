\chapter{System Modeling}
This chapter presents the nonlinear mathematical model of the Ball-in-Tube system. The forces acting on the ball, including gravity and aerodynamic drag, are formulated, and the fan dynamics are represented as a first-order system. Using the parameters provided in the laboratory instructions, the complete nonlinear state-space model is derived and prepared for later linearization and simulation.
