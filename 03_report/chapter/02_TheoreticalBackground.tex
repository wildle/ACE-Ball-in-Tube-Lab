\chapter{Theoretical Background}
This chapter summarizes the relevant theoretical concepts required to understand the Ball-in-Tube system. It briefly reviews nonlinear system dynamics, the modeling of aerodynamic forces, and the PT1 behavior of the fan. Furthermore, fundamental control concepts such as linearization around an operating point, PID control, and differential flatness for trajectory planning are introduced to provide the foundation for subsequent sections.
