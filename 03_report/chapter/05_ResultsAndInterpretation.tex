\chapter{Results and Interpretation}
Based on the linearized model, a PID controller is designed using MATLAB's \texttt{pidTuner}. The influence of gains, noise, and actuator limits is discussed. Practical considerations such as integrator windup protection, signal filtering, and handling of nonlinear constraints are addressed to ensure a robust closed-loop performance.
