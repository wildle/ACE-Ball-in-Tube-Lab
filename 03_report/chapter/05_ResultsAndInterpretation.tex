\chapter{Results and Interpretation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Comparison of measured fan step response with the identified PT1 model.
    \item Validation of the linear model against the nonlinear model for small perturbations.
    \item Closed-loop behavior with PID control: rise time, overshoot, steady-state behaviour.
    \item Effect of voltage saturation on control performance.
    \item Influence of measurement noise and performance of the optional measurement filter.
    \item Trajectory tracking results with and without feed-forward compensation.
    \item Discussion of nonlinear effects and mismatch between linear and nonlinear dynamics.
    \item Interpretation of limitations and remaining discrepancies in controller performance.
